# R Subsetting Error: Accessing Columns of Empty Data Frames

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in R related to subsetting data frames.  The error occurs when attempting to access columns of an empty data frame resulting from a subsetting operation where no rows satisfy the condition.

The `bug.R` file contains the code that produces the error.  The `bugSolution.R` file provides a solution to handle this scenario gracefully.

## Error Description

When a subsetting operation on a data frame returns an empty data frame, attempting to access its columns can lead to silent failures or cryptic errors, making it difficult to debug.  This is particularly problematic when the subsetting condition is dynamic and may occasionally yield an empty result.

## Solution

The best way to avoid this type of error is to check if the subset is empty before attempting to access any of its columns.  The `bugSolution.R` file demonstrates how to do this using the `nrow()` function.
